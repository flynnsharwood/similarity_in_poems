# similarity_in_poems
Finding how similar poems are with cosine similarity 

First of all, decapitalise the texts you wanna find similarity for.

You will get a matrix of 7*7 in this case, it will depend on how many separate piece of text you add
The diagonal from top left to bottom right should always have [1]s

according to how similar the poems are, the values will vary from 0 being not similar at all to 1 being completely similar
